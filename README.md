## ðŸŽ¶ Jukebox

Jukebox is a front-end Android project designed to improve music at social events. Itâ€™s not always easy to have good music, since hosts may lack inspiration and time to create playlists, and guests may disagree with song choices or be too shy to suggest songs. Our app allows guests to suggest songs before the party starts, skip songs during the party, and for hosts to set more fine-grained controls on these systems.

Project was completed for CS465 (User Interface Design) at [The University Of Illinois](https://illinois.edu/)
