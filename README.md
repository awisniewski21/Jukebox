# What is Jukebox? ðŸŽ¶

Jukebox is a front-end Android project designed to improve music at social events. Itâ€™s not always easy to have good music, since hosts may lack inspiration and time to create playlists, and guests may disagree with song choices or be too shy to suggest songs. Our app allows guests to suggest songs before the party starts, skip songs during the party, and for hosts to set more fine-grained controls on these systems.

This project was completed as part of CS465 (User Interface Design) at [The University Of Illinois](https://illinois.edu/).

# Host: Creating a Party

## Enter Party Information
To create a party, the host first enters in information about the party, such as the name, theme, date, time, and location. Then, they can choose to set limits on song suggestions and skips. These are designed to avoid a vocal minority taking control of the party's music.

# Guests: Joining a Party in Advance
Guests can join a party by entering the corresponding four-letter party code. If the code is valid, guests can then see the details about the party and submit song suggestions before the party begins.

# Guests: Joining an Ongoing Party
Guests can join an ongoing party in a similar fashion as before. They are given a chance to vote to skip at the beginning of each song. They can also vote on what the next song should be. If not enough votes to skip are received within the timeframe, votes are no longer allowed until the next song begins. The number of votes needed to skip and the time given to skip are configurable by the host.
